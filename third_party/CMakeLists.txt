# Third-party dependencies

# Currently no third-party libraries are required
# In production, this would include:
# - nlohmann/json for robust JSON parsing
# - libcurl for HTTP requests (if not using platform native)
# - OpenSSL for encryption (if not using platform native)
# - Catch2 or GoogleTest for unit testing

# Placeholder for future dependencies
